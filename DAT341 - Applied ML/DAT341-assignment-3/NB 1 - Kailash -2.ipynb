I felt completely back to normal in two days. Yes, this is a serious reaction and it can be really scary, but you know what I think is scarier? All the lasting side-effects that the diseases can give you, or dying of them. I have a friend who used to run marathons and had COVID early on in the pandemic. She's still recovering and gets short of breath walking up the stairs. That's a much worse outcome to me than what I went through. All in all, I'm currently in a special medical program here for people who had a severe reaction but want to get fully vaccinated safely, and I refuse to let people try and use my experience with vaccines as an argument that GETTING SICK and DYING or suffering LONG LASTING COMPLICATIONS is somehow BETTER than running the small risk of feeling bad for a couple of days. And thats not even adressing the hate people have against autism! Vaccines don't cause autism, it's been debunked again and again. And even if they did, are you telling me you hate me so much you'd rather let your kids potentially suffer or die of a completely preventable disease?

We just didn’t hear much about those because Ebola was contained, mostly by isolation, before widespread immunization could be rolled out. Because it was tested and passed by multiple panels of scientists with more relevant credentials than yours, mine or the person you follow on Twitter. Literally millions of people have received COVID-19 vaccine with only a very tiny minority (less than 1 in 100,000) have had a serious problem like blood clots. Headaches, body aches, sore arms and being tired for a couple of days don’t count as safety problems. They are NOTHING compared to symptomatic COVID, which at least 10% (1 in 10) of the unimmunized population has had. Because nearly all of those that have received the vaccine have not gotten symptomatic COVID-19 and only a VERY tiny number have had serious COVID-19 and been hospitalized or died. 2/3 of the people that did have severe COVID-19 after immunization had pre-existing problems with their immunity that kept them from receiving full benefit from their vaccine. (Vaccines tell your immune system how to get ready to fight the virus or bacteria they are against. If your immune system is unable to respond, either due to a rare genetic syndrome, or more likely due to a blood cancer like leukemia or immune suppressing drugs, like chemotherapy or drugs for diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, then it is the defect in the immune system’s ability to respond, not a problem with the vaccine that caused the “failure”.)

Myocarditis is far more common as a result of Covid-19 disease, than as a result of vaccination. There are far more risks from Covid-19 disease than just myocarditis. Myocarditis from vaccination is much easier to treat and less dangerous than from disease. The risk of myocarditis from vaccination is between 1 and 10 per 100,000 dependent on age/sex. The risk of myocarditis as a result of Covid-19 disease is 146 in 100,000. These figures are for Pfizer vaccine. Given the choice it might be sensible for young adult males to get Pfizer rather than Moderna as the risk from Moderna vaccine is slightly higher in that age group, but if they don’t have a choice between vaccines, it’s still a better balance of risk to get vaccinated with Moderna, than not to be vaccinated at all."},{"stance":"0","comment":"For those who say I don't what's in it do you know what's in the everyday pills you take"},{"stance":"0","comment":"For what it's worth insurance companies could add a surcharge for the unvaccinated as they do for smokers Frankly it's too late in general, Delta is going run thru the nation for the next several weeks and we will have a measure of herd immunity then.

I am one of those who have opted not to take the vaccine. My primary reason for this is that I want to see studies regarding long term side effects. It is much too early to know what this vaccine may do to human bodies as time passes. Also, this is considered an experimental vaccine. I am not a guinea pig. I know there was a need for something to stave off this horrible virus early on, so I can understand rushing the vaccine. I have read that all the vaccines have been developed and tested by scientists and that it is said that it won’t cause harm in the long term. I am not satisfied with that answer. I want to know about possible side effects 2 years, 5 years, 10 years down the road. I’ve been doing my research since this virus came out. I don’t proclaim to be a doctor or scientist by any stretch. But so far, I have learned that vaccinated people are catching and spreading the virus, just as much as unvaccinated people. They say the vaccine prevents people from having terrible symptoms and even death. That may be true, I just do not know. I do know several vaccinated people who have caught covid, but had milder symptoms. Another reason I have not taken the vaccine is that all I do know just doesn’t make sense. Information changes daily. Wear a mask, masks don’t stop the virus. Lock down, don’t lock down. We have already gone through the masking and lockdown and it didn’t do one bit of good in keeping people safe from covid. So here is my question. Why should I take an experimental vaccine that doesn’t keep me from getting or spreading covid and nobody can give me information regarding long term side effects. These vaccines are not made to actually stop covid. I’ve also read that vaccines can cause viruses to mutate. I can’t rattle off all the science involved in that, but several articles I have read indicate that to be true. Covid is not the only vaccine that does this. Others, such as the flu vaccine, do it too. Does it make sense to take a vaccine that will cause mutations and more variants of the virus? The new vaccine coming out from Pfizer that is suppose to receive approval from the FDA has me raising my eyebrows. I don’t trust the FDA, look at what they have done with our medicines and foods. The stuff that goes into some of those things is pure poison to the human body. Also, why are GMO foods approved by the FDA? It’s all about money. But back to Pfizer. Did you know that Pfizer holds the record for receiving the largest criminal fine in history? They purposefully misrepresented a pain medicine that has since been removed from the market. How am I supposed to trust a company that did that? With all the controversy about the vaccines, why would I decide to take one that is manufactured by a crooked company? How do I know that it is safe? It is another rushed vaccine. Just because the FDA gives it their approval doesn’t mean that it is safer than any of the others. I’ve read that the human immune system is 13 times more efficient at warding off covid than this newest vaccine. It is being pushed too hard. For a virus that has a 99% survival rate, what is the big to do over the vaccine? All this talk about carrying a vaccination card in order to get into various places is just ridiculous. That is just government controlling us. I have a right to say what goes into my body and what does not. The day someone comes to my door demanding that I take a vaccine will be the day when I know we are doomed, and our freedoms will be taken away one by one. I’m not downplaying the seriousness of the Covid 19 virus. It is a nasty bug than has killed lots of people. The death rates are not too high with the new variant, comparably speaking. But it is still nasty. I take precautions against getting sick. I take Vitamin D and Zinc and Vitamin C and Vitamin A, all have been proven to help keep covid away. There are some other avenues that I’m looking at as well. I stay away from crowds and practice good hygiene. And I pray. Basically, I don’t know enough about the vaccine to just blindly allow substances to be put in my body that no one can tell me won’t cause problems somewhere down the line. At this point, they are talking about booster shots for vaccinated people. How many booster shots will we have to have? One a year, like the flu? Or one everytime the virus mutates and brings about another variant? I’m just not up for that. Those are some of my personal reasons for deciding not to take the vaccine. Knowing what we know about it, I don’t know why people get so irate with folks like me who are critical thinkers and want answers. It’s none of my business if other take the vaccine. It’s their body and their decision. And it’s no one elses business whether or not I take the vaccine. It is my body and my personal choice to take it or not."},{"stance":"0","comment":"Oh come on how do you expect your terrified brainwashed sheep to stay in line if you stop saying everyone is going to die of Covid if you don't get an ineffective vaccine!!!!"},{"stance":"1","comment":"Oh dear EUronews, this article hasn't even made it to the end of the day before the conclusions it tries to draw are shown invalid.

What does exist is our natural ability to remove toxins from our bodies, they accumulate over months and when the seasons change or if a person suddenly starts to stay indoors out of sunlight the immune system responds and begins to produce various forms of viral matter, this matter dissolves waste material such as dead/dying cells and toxins we have ingested/absorbed over time, these dissolved substances are then absorbed into the blood and then bind to white blood cells so the larger mass can be captured and excreted from the body and this process requires energy and produces heat so we feel a fever and discomfort. If in this state you allow them to analyse your sputum/mucus and blood they will find protein markers pertaining to the viral matter you are producing. They lie when they say we transmit these viruses, they are non-living and are inert when outside of the body, if inhaled our own viral matter identifies it as foreign and dissolves itself and the waste matter it was bonded to. The whole feeling of having \"the flu\" is your body doing what it is supposed to do and you are supposed to ride it out and supplement your immune system with vitamins C, D & E, by tablets or by eating fruit and veg and go outside in the sunlight even if it is overcast.

I studied the ingredients and I think it should be noted that the mRNA vaccines have no preservatives, heavy metals, or antibiotics which is by far the \"cleanest\" vaccine I've had (which probably helped with no adverse events, in my case). Also, since I'm a researcher in the sciences (benchwork and beyond), I already knew that the basic components disintegrate fairly fast so long-term effects from the vaccine itself is small. Please mention to individuals getting the vaccine that it's wise to layoff the anti-inflammatories, acetaminophen, and alcohol for about 48 hours prior to the jab to 72 hours post-jab. I know many people taking Aleve, etc. a few hours before their appointment in anticipation of the effects.. we want our immune system to be full-on during the vaccine process.

They aren't alive, so they can't just keep reproducing or hiding out in the body.¹ Whatever they're gonna do to you (mainly trigger an immune response), they will do right away. The only long-term effect is from your immune response, because your immune system has a sort of memory system for exactly this purpose. Now... if COVID prevention were more like malaria prevention, or birth control, or antidepressants, where you take medication on a regular basis for years and years — then yes, of course it would be possible for long-term side effects to emerge. Examples of that sort of thing are easy to find. But vaccines aren't like that. We don't take an anti-COVID pill every week. It's just 1 or 2 shots, which show up in the body, do their thing, then break down and get flushed out. I don't think yours is a dumb question. It's just a question to which we happen to have a good answer. And it's not to say vaccines can't have negative and unexpected side effects. They can! But the point is, whatever it's gonna do to you, it's gonna do right away while it's in the body. With the amount of testing and scrutiny we've had for the approved COVID vaccines, we can be pretty confident that we've found and quantified all the risks. Anything we've missed would have to be really, really rare, like 1 case per 10 million doses or whatever. ¹There are some vaccines using a different virus as a vector to get the right stuff to the right place. So those are \"alive\" in a sense. But they picked well-known, relatively harmless viruses — adenoviruses associated with the common cold, or the like. Still not something to worry about, IMO, any more than we worry about the long-term side effects of catching the common cold.

To start with, the largest studies dispelling the MMR vaccine-autism \"link\" are not even American, but Scandinavian, so even if an American organisation fiddle with the data to \"cover up\" things, there are plenty of other studies that explore the potential link between MMR and autism and find there is none. The only one study that does find a link is the Wakefield study, with was retracted due to being fraudulent. Also, I'd like to gently remind everyone re. graphs that correlation does NOT equal causation. The apparent rise in autism is disputed too. There is a rise in autism DIAGNOSES, but then a lot of things that were previously diagnosed as retardation or childhood psychosis or (in the Asperger end of the autism spectrum) not diagnosed at all, is today diagnosed as autism spectrum disorders. Also, please just cut it and wake up from the Antivaxxer conspiracy. The impacts of not vaccinating children due to the fictive MMR-autism link cause serious harm in society, such as vulnerable people (babies, old, sick) suffering and dying from preventable diseases, and people with immune deficiencies having to avoid others and live in fear because they can no longer trust that they are protected by the general societal herd immunity, as it is slipping under the minimum required proportions for a number of severe, once eradicated diseases.

When you add in the stringent red tape of the FDA, this process takes a long time. These processes were given a freeway to approval for Covid. And with BILLIONS dumped into research and development by the government for these vaccines, it's perfectly reasonable why they were produced as quickly as they were. Pharma companies don't dump billions into vaccine research. Which is another reason why it normally takes years to make. There is a massive misconception of \"not enough time to study, we don't know the long term effects\". This statement is proof in itself that you literally don't know what you are talking about. For one, take the mRNA Moderna vaccine. The mRNA is the only active ingredient. Do you know what else makes up the rest of it? Salt, sugar, and lipids. All of which have been in your body thousands of times. The mRNA was proven completely safe as your body naturally breaks it down almost immediately. The number one severe side effect of vaccines is allergic reaction. This happens usually within 15-30 minutes. Most other side affects appear within a few days. After two weeks the chances of side effects are essentially zero. There is no \"long term\" side effects. That's an anti vaxxers stance and it's completely made up. In summary, vaccines take years to make not because they are worried about the long term side effects. But simply because of money, manpower, and red tape.

So the AZ vaccine has not been derived from any novel approach from a standing start. So I have a lot of confidence in AZ and how they have developed this vaccine. Its a very similar approach to how many other vaccines are developed and which we all have when we go on holiday to different parts of the world without any concerns. All medication carries a risk, even simple paracetomol, because all of us react to medication in different ways. But to be honest having a Covid vaccination is the only way out of this crisis whatever you think and the more people who have the vaccinations, the less opportunity the virus will have to mutate in to something much much worse.
